Atlas is a Discord nuker written in `Java 22` and `Maven` (or `OpenJDK 22`). Atlas has 5 features like: delete & create channels, roles and webhooks; spam with webhooks; re-name the guild/server.

To use it, please install the `Java 22` (tested so far) and google "how to run a .jar file".

Atlas was just my small project, so it was made on quick hand for 3 days. Some of stuff are not done and I do not have time, motivation and desire to continue & maintain this project. If you want to continue, you can fork this repository, but please **make sure that you credit me for the main source code.**

If there are any forks of this repository that still maintain and fixing the issues, **please support them üôè.**
